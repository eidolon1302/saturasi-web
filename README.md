# Deploy on your own

## On Vercel

### :film\_projector: [Check Out Step By Step Video Tutorial By @codeSTACKr](https://youtu.be/n6d4KHSKqGk?t=107)

Since the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api` could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!

> [!NOTE]\
> Since [#58](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/pull/58), we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have fewer issues with downtime :grin:.

> [!NOTE]\
> If you are on the [Pro (i.e. paid)](https://vercel.com/pricing) Vercel plan, the [maxDuration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#value-definition) value found in the [vercel.json](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/vercel.json) can be increased when your Vercel instance frequently times out during the card request. You are advised to keep this value lower than `30` seconds to prevent high memory usage.

8.  Click the `Continue with GitHub` button, search for the required Git Repository and import it by clicking the `Import` button. Alternatively, you can import a Third-Party Git Repository using the `Import Third-Party Git Repository ->` link at the bottom of the page.

9.  Create a personal access token (PAT) [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and enable the `repo` and `user` permissions (this allows access to see private repo and user stats).
10. Add the PAT as an environment variable named `PAT_1` (as shown).

## On other platforms

> [!WARNING]\
> This way of using GRS is not officially supported and was added to cater to some particular use cases where Vercel could not be used (e.g. [#2341](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/discussions/2341)). The support for this method, therefore, is limited.

<details>
<summary><b>:hammer_and_wrench: Step-by-step guide for deploying on other platforms</b></summary>

1.  Fork or clone this repo as per your needs
2.  Add `express` to the dependencies section of `package.json`
    <https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/ba7c2f8b55eac8452e479c8bd38b044d204d0424/package.json#L54-L61>
3.  Run `npm i` if needed (initial setup)
4.  Run `node express.js` to start the server, or set the entry point to `express.js` in `package.json` if you're deploying on a managed service
    <https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/ba7c2f8b55eac8452e479c8bd38b044d204d0424/package.json#L11>
5.  You're done ðŸŽ‰

## Disable rate limit protections

Github Readme Stats contains several Vercel environment variables that can be used to remove the rate limit protections:

*   `CACHE_SECONDS`: This environment variable takes precedence over our cache minimum and maximum values and can circumvent these values for self-hosted Vercel instances.

See [the Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) on adding these environment variables to your Vercel instance.

## Keep your fork up to date

You can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using GitHub's [Sync Fork button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork). You can also use the [pull](https://github.com/wei/pull) package created by [@wei](https://github.com/wei) to automate this process.

# :sparkling\_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

*   Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it. :D
*   Starring and sharing the project. :rocket:
*   [![paypal.me/anuraghazra](https://ionicabizau.github.io/badges/paypal.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/anuraghazra) - You can make a one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:

Thanks! :heart:
